# CSS Pre-Processors and CSS Libraries

There are a number of options here. If you are familiar with using command line tools and Node.js there is Node.js implementation of Sass see https://sass-lang.com/install.

Alternatively you can use an application with a graphical user interface to compile Sass code. There are several different applications out there. The instructions below describe the use of Koala, it's free and easy to use.

## Getting Started with Sass and Koala

### Setting up
* Download and install Koala - http://koala-app.com/
* Download this repository.
  * Open *index.html* and *style.scss* in a text editor.
    *style.scss* is where we will write our Sass code.
* Open the web page in a browser. Note that at the moment it doesn't have any CSS applied to it.
* Open Koala.
* Drag the folder that contains *index.html* onto Koala.
* Koala should automatically detect the *style.scss* in the sass folder.
* Right click on *style.scss* and select compile.
* Koala should generate a CSS file for you based on the *.scss* file. Check you can find this generated CSS file. It should be in a folder called css.
* Refresh *index.html* in a browser, it should now have some CSS applied.
* Take a moment to make sure you understand what has happened.
* The basic workflow is to make changes to *style.scss*. Koala will then compile this for us into plain CSS. We can then refresh the browser to see the changes.

### Re-write the CSS using Sass
Now experiment with the basic feature of Sass. Try the following:
1. Use Sass variables instead of hard coded font and colour names.
2. Put your variables in a separate *_vars.scss* partial file. Use an *use* to load them into *style.scss*.
3. Experiment with using mixins, nesting and extends. You should be able to re-use CSS rules and reduce the number of classes used in the HTML page. Try and make your CSS efficient and easy to maintain.
